      <title>Inhibition of the DDX3 prevents HIV-1 Tat and cocaine-induced neurotoxicity by targeting microglia activation</title>

      <description>HIV-1 Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) is commonly seen in HIV-infected patients. Viral proteins including Tat cause neuronal toxicity and is worsened by drugs of abuse. To uncover potential targets for anti-HAND therapy, we employed a literature mining system, MOLIERE. Here, we validated Dead Box RNA Helicase 3 (DDX3) as a target to treat HAND via a selective DDX3 inhibitor, RK-33. The combined neurotoxicity of Tat protein and cocaine was blocked by RK-33 in rat and mouse cortical cultures.</description>

      <title>Using Drive-by Health Monitoring to Detect Bridge Damage Considering Environmental and Operational Effects</title>

      <description>Drive-by Health Monitoring utilizes accelerometers mounted on commercial and civilian vehicles to gather dynamic response data that can be used to continuously evaluate the health of bridges faster and with less equipment than traditional structural health monitoring practices. Because vehicles and bridges create a coupled system, vehicle acceleration data contains information about bridge frequencies that can be used as health indicators. However, for drive-by health monitoring to be viable, variabilities in dynamic measurements caused by environmental and operational parameters, such as temperature, vehicle speed, traffic, and surface roughness need to be considered.</description>

      <title>To Agile or Not to Agile: A Comparison of Software Development Methodologies</title>

      <description>During the graduate course on software development methods, Ruslan Shaydulin and I put together a paper analyzing different software methodologies. We find, through our literature review, that the landscape of methodologies has changed rapidly within the last decade. Additionally, we find a large number of pros and cons for all methodologies.
These strengths and weaknesses are detailed in the associated work. Note, this work is unpublished.</description>
