      <title>Are Abstracts Enough for Hypothesis Generation?</title>

      <description>Our goal in this paper is to understand the effect data quality has on our hypothesis generation system, Moliere. We train multiple instances of our system and apply our validation techniques to numerically quantify performance differences.
Our different datasets come from Medline and PubMed Central. This required a fair amount cleaning and random sampling, so those wishing to replicate our findings are encouraged to start with the pre-trained datasets. These datasets are preconstructed using data that predates 2010.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Validation of Hypothesis Generation Systems via Candidate Ranking</title>

      <description>We explore and implement a number of validation methods in this work. In order to run these for yourself, first setup the Moliere project from our github page. A fair warning, you will need some pretty powerful compute resources. Feel free to reach out or file a github issue for help on that front.
Because the Moliere project represents a significant portion the lead authors thesis work, this codebase is subject to change.</description>

      <title>MOLIERE: Automatic Biomedical Hypothesis Generation System</title>
      <link>http://sybrandt.com/publication/moliere-automatic-biomedical-hypothesis-generation/</link>

      <description>MOLIERE is a hypothesis generation system which is able to identify potential relationships from large text corpora. Our presented system was trained on the MEDLINE dataset, containing nearly 25 million documents dating back to the late 1800&amp;rsquo;s. We validate our system by predicting recent findings using only information present before 2010. These validations efforts are confirmed with the help of a domain expert.
