      <description>In a previous post I talked about how tools like word2vec are used to numerically understand the meanings behind words. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to continue that discussion by describing ways we can find numerical representations for whole documents. So, I&amp;rsquo;ll be assuming you&amp;rsquo;re already familiar with the concept of word embeddings.
Why do we need document embeddings? Many real-world applications need to understand the content of text which is longer than just a single word.</description>

      <description>Recently, in text mining circles, a new method of representing words has taken off. This has been due, in a large part, to recent papers from Mikolov et al. and tools like word2vec 1. Since then, many other projects have applied this concept to a wide variety of areas within data mining 2. So what is all the hype about? What are these embeddings and why do we need them?</description>
