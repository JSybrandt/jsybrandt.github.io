      <description>So recently, I needed to parallelize a lot of my old code. This initially seemed like a daunting task. Now its not like I&amp;rsquo;ve never had to write parallel code before, and its not like my task was that hard. My issue primarily came from a staunch unwillingness to look anything up. After all, I could just throw my problem into python, right?
While that may be true, the version of myself today would like to tell the version of myself from last week that the C++ solution is not as bad as I thought.</description>
