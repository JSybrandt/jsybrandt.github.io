      <title>MOLIERE: Automatic Biomedical Hypothesis Generation</title>

      <description>MOLIERE, originally presented at KDD&amp;rsquo;17, is a system which can identify connections within medical literature. In order to increase the productivity of medical researchers, we are attempting to deploy the pipeline to perform at scale. Along with this come a series of complications regarding the scale of the MEDLINE data set and the use-cases of scientists.
This project is being pursued primarily by an aspiring group of undergraduate students in Clemson&amp;rsquo;s Seminar for Professional Issues class.</description>

      <title>Rapid Replication of Multi-Petabyte File Systems</title>

      <description>DistSync was presented as a Work in Progress (WIP) at the Parallel Data Storage Workshop, as well as in the SC&amp;rsquo;15 poster session. This work was done along with the storage systems group at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC).
We developed distsync in order to facilitate the move from the Oakland Scientific Facility into a new building at the LBNL Berkeley campus. As part of this process, the scratch file system at the old location needed to be syncronized with an out of date replica present at the new location.</description>
