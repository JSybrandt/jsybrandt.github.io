    <p>Now that I am wrapping up my Ph.D., an endeavor that has defined my last four
years, it seems as good a time as any to take stock of the advice I&rsquo;ve given and
received. I&rsquo;m recording this mostly for myself, in hopes that a few years from
now I might do this again and compare notes. However, I also hope that if any
up-and-coming grad students stumble on this list, maybe it might do some good.
Also, given there&rsquo;s a pandemic outside, this seems as good a time as any to wax
philosophical.</p>
<p>I did my best to only include information I found useful. I&rsquo;m very aware that a
lot of this advice is contradictory, at least in part. Take all of this with a
grain of salt. I am graduating from Clemson University with a Ph.D. in computer
science, a focus on machine learning, and will be starting a career in industry.
While I hope you find this information useful, results may vary.</p>
<h2 id="advice-i-received-and-followed">Advice I Received and Followed</h2>
<p>Before and during my Ph.D. I received a lot of really helpful information.
Without this advice I&rsquo;m not sure I would have been able to make it out in four
years. However, I don&rsquo;t want to take credit for any of this. My undergraduate
advisers, and a healthy helping of <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/">Matt Might&rsquo;s Grad School
articles</a> left a deep impression. Furthermore, my</p>
