      <title>MOLIERE: Automatic Biomedical Hypothesis Generation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MOLIERE, originally presented at &lt;a href=&#34;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3098057&amp;amp;CFID=985180416&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;KDD&amp;rsquo;17&lt;/a&gt;, is a system which can identify connections within medical literature.
In order to increase the productivity of medical researchers, we are attempting to deploy the pipeline to perform at scale.
Along with this come a series of complications regarding the scale of the MEDLINE data set and the use-cases of scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is being pursued primarily by an aspiring group of undergraduate students in Clemson&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Seminar for Professional Issues&lt;/em&gt; class.
Progress soon to come!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bridge Health Classification With Automotive Sensing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project, I am applying machine learning techniques to identify the structural health of arbitrary bridges.
Our goal is to collect data related to bridge health, such as vertical acceleration and harmonic frequency, through sensors present in vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming years, smart cars will be more prevalent.
This will facilitate community planning and monitoring projects, such as this.
We attempt to ready ourselves for this future by identifying the techniques and methods nessesary to gather and interpret this very noisy data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learn to Program Python</title>
      <link>http://sybrandt.com/project/learn-to-program-python/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I, on occasion, put together python tutorial videos as a way to explain the basics of programming to interested friends.
Unfortunately, with my schedule, these don&amp;rsquo;t come out as often as I would like, but the episodes are available for anyone interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look for updates to this series on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdEl10kp62Y&amp;amp;list=PL7Qcg0xHM7prCRBfgfQCXekKx5vOQxayc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rapid Replication of Multi-Petabyte File Systems</title>
      <link>http://sybrandt.com/project/rapid-replication-of-multipetabyte-filesystems/</link>

      <guid>http://sybrandt.com/project/rapid-replication-of-multipetabyte-filesystems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DistSync was presented as a Work in Progress (WIP) at the Parallel Data Storage Workshop, as well as in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sc15.supercomputing.org/sites/all/themes/SC15images/src_poster/poster_files/spost103s2-file1.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SC&amp;rsquo;15 poster session&lt;/a&gt;.
This work was done along with the storage systems group at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nersc.gov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We developed distsync in order to facilitate the move from the Oakland Scientific Facility into a new building at the LBNL Berkeley campus.
As part of this process, the scratch file system at the old location needed to be syncronized with an out of date replica present at the new location.
Distsync dramatically reduced the time needed to process this syncronization.&lt;/p&gt;
