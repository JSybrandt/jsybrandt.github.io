I'm here in Seattle, WA attending the [IEEE International Conference on Big Data][conference_link].
I'll be presenting two recent works.
[The first][validation_link], presents a new method to validate hypothesis generation systems.
[The second][abstracts_link], uses that method to determine the quality of input papers needed to make good conclusions.
With two papers in the same conference, I will be giving a double-length talk!
If you're around, I'll be at the end of the L12 session Wednesday morning.
