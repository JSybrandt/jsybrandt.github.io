I was very happy to have a chance to talk about my recent work
[Agatha][agatha] with the great people over at the [A.I. Socratic
Circles][aisc] group! The talk was a "lunch & learn" recorded from quarantine, and broadcaster on [YouTube][aisc_youtube]. Check it out if you're interested in Agatha but missed the live session!

Here's the slides:
