How to solve complex problems with text. 

This talk was given at the Clemson Applied Data Science course on November
10'th, 2019. It is supposed to give people new to machine learning an overview
of whats been going on in the world of text mining, with very little assumed
prior knowledge. 

Although we do go quickly from Bag-of-Word and TF-IDF to modern transformer
models, this talk should serve as a solid entry point for anyone interested in
the field.
