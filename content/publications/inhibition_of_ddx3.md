## Abstract:


HIV-1 Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) is commonly seen in HIV-infected
patients. Viral proteins including Tat cause neuronal toxicity and is worsened
by drugs of abuse. To uncover potential targets for anti-HAND therapy, we
employed a literature mining system, MOLIERE. Here, we validated Dead Box RNA
Helicase 3 (DDX3) as a target to treat HAND via a selective DDX3 inhibitor,
RK-33. The combined neurotoxicity of Tat protein and cocaine was blocked by
RK-33 in rat and mouse cortical cultures. Transcriptome analysis showed that
Tat-activated transcripts include makers and regulators of microglial
activation, and RK-33 blocked Tat-induced activation of these mRNAs.  Elevated
production of proinflammatory cytokines was also inhibited by RK-33.  These
findings show that DDX3 contributes to microglial activation triggered by Tat
and cocaine, and DDX3 inhibition shows promise as a therapy for HAND.  Moreover,
DDX3 may contribute to the pathology of other neurodegenerative diseases with
pathological activation of microglia
